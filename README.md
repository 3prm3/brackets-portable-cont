# brackets portable

## Overview
Brackets is an open source code editor for web designers and front-end developers.

With brackets portable you can now 'install' it on a USB and have it with you at all times.

This portable launcher (with brackets embedded) will not leave any file/registry leftovers in your PC and will store all information in the portable folder.

All custom extensions you install will also be stored in the portable folder and will carried with you in your USB.

You can also replace the brackets installation inside this portable version with any version you like.

The portable launcher uses the portableapps.com installer which also allows you to better integrate with your portableapps.com installation (this is of course optional).

For portable chrome support please use the second 'BracketsPortableWithPortableChromeSupport.exe' exe file (requires admin permissions).
